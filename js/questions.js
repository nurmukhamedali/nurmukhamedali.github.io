		que: "Answer each question yes or no. Must two quantities have the same dimensions (a) if you are adding them? (h) If you are multiplying them? (c) If you are subtracting them? (d) If you are dividing them? (e) If you are equating them?",
		sol: "The answer is yes for (a), (c), and (e). You cannot add or subtract a number of apples and a number of jokes. The answer is no for (b) and (d). Consider the gauge of a sausage, 4 kg/2 m, or the volume of a cube, (2 m)3. Thus we have (a) yes; (b) no; (c) yes; (d) no; and (e) yes. ",

		que: "An automobile company displays a die-cast model of its first car, made from 9.35 kg of iron. To celebrate its hundredth year in business, a worker will recast the model in solid gold from the original dies. What mass of gold is needed to make the new model?",
		sol: "Let V represent the volume of the model, the same in ρ = mV , for both. Then ρiron = 9.35 kg/V and ρgold = mgold/V . Next, ρgold/ρiron = mgold/9.35 kg and mgold = (9.35 kg)((19.3 × 103 kg/m3) / (7.87 × 103 kg/m3)) = 22.9 kg"

		que: "(i) A metallic coin is given a positive electric charge. Does its mass (a) increase measurably, (b) increase by an amount too small to measure directly, (c) remain unchanged, (d) decrease by an amount too small to measure directly, or (e) decrease measurably? (ii) Now the coin is given a negative electric charge. What happens to its mass? Choose from the same possibilities as in part (i).",
		sol: "The metallic coin is a conductor which consists of a large number of free electrons that are available for the electric conduction. These free electrons are not bound to the atom. The metallic coin is given a positive charge then some of the free electrons are removed from the metallic coin this decreases the mass of the coin. The mass of the electron is very small and the amount of decrease in the mass of the metallic coin decreases by an amount too small to measure directly."

		que: "Nobel laureate Richard Feynman (1918–1088) once said that if two persons stood at arm’s length from each other and each person had 1% more electrons than protons, the force of repulsion between them would be enough to lift a “weight” equal to that of the entire Earth. Carry out an order-of-magnitude calculation to substantiate this assertion.",

		que: "What happens when a charged insulator is placed near an uncharged metallic object? (a) They repel each other. (b) They attract each other. (c) They may attract or repel each other, depending on whether the charge on the insulator is positive or negative. (d) They exert no electrostatic force on each other. (e) The charged insulator always spontaneously discharges.",
		sol: "A charged insulator is placed near an uncharged metallic object the charged insulator induces charges on to the uncharged metallic object. The charge appears on the metallic body. This is because it attracts or repels electrons in the atoms of the uncharged body which are at the surface or near the surface."

		que: "An object with negative charge is placed in a region of space where the electric field is directed vertically upward. What is the direction of the electric force exerted on this charge? (a) It is up. (b) It is down. (c) There is no force. (d) The force can be in any direction.",
		sol: "From equation (1), the direction of electric force exerted on the charge is opposite to the direction of the electric field due to the negative sign of the charge. The negative charge accelerates in the opposite direction of the electric field. So, the direction of electric force exerted on the negative charge is downwards"
